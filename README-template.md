## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
//to toggle between plus and minus
let minus = eachContent.querySelector(".minus");
minus.classList.toggle("hidden");
let plus = eachContent.querySelector(".plus");
plus.classList.toggle("hidden");
```

### Continued development

In the future I want to perfect to make my js code efficient as much as possible as it helps maintain a simple and maintainable code.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_toggle_class.asp) - This helps on how to toggle between adding and removing a class name from an element with JavaScript.
